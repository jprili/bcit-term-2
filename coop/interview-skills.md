# Types of quesitons

## The Killer Question
> Tell me about yourself. 

Think **PAWS**.
* Personal 
* Academic
* Work
* Skills

Ask yourself: Does this story matter?  
Solution: Practice, practice, practice!  

There's also a three step approach:
1. Who you are
2. Your highlight reel
3. Why you're here

Q: What would you say?  
A (James):  
My name is James, a current Computer Systems Technology Student and just recently graduated from UBC's Physics program.  
My time at university involved writing research papers and building programs for experiments and simulations, which is where most of my experience coming from.  
I am also a former Software Engineer for NETGEAR, responsible for automating and speeding up their mobile hotspot validation, as well as a teaching assistant for a 1st year physics course.  
These experiences honed my skills in systematic programming, as well as communication and management skills.

## Strengths and Weaknesses
> What are your strengths?
* Give three and back it up (be concrete!).
* What are you bringing to the company?

> What is your weakness?
* "An area that I'm currently working on is ..."

> Why should we hire you?
* Summarise your selling points & reiterate.

## Situational
> What would you do in this situation?
* Best answered using an example if possible.

## Behavioural
> Give a time where you ...
* STAR: Situation, Task, Action, Result

# Brainstorming a Story
1. Look at the job description.  
2. Highlight skills as keywords in the description.  
3. Think about stories for each keyword, in STAR format.  

Example (James):
> Tell me about a time you showed initiative.
S: I was working as a general labourer in a panelling company, and one of the responsibilities that we do is receive incoming packages for the office.  
One time, a coworker of mine signed a package that had the wrong contents (the deliveryperson may have accidentally switched it), but the delivery person already left the area.  
T: We needed to find a way to get the right order.  
A: Thankfully the box with the package had a phone number with it, so I immediately called the company. (refine details)  
R: The delivery person then came back and got the correct box. [Add more, feedback (what if you didn't do that?)]  

# Technical Questions
* Demonstrate the thought process
* Ask quesitons to clarify
* Demonstrate how you would find the answer

> Answering questions and don't know the answer?
> - Go hypothetical (acknowledge it though)
> - Try a similar analogue

# Your questions
* Prepare 3-5 questions - PRIORITISE
* Always ask well thought-out and relevant questions
* Engage all interviewers
* No matter wat, always ask 1-2 questions
* Next steps?
