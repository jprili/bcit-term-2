BCIT Term 2
==

This is James' note repository for BCIT term 202510 for the DTC campus.  
I'm in the co-op program so I'm taking notes for the seminars and whiteboarding as well.  

Currently, I am requesting to exempt COMP 2522 and COMP 2121 since I've taken similar courses before,  
so I might just stop taking notes if I get the message.  

If you want to be a collaborator, send me a message here on GitHub or on Discord `@jprili_bcit`.

Good luck and have fun!
