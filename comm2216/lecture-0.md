# Resumes
A process to build a strong document for the intended reader.

The job market sucks at the moment.
But Sam sees an opportunity.

There is a positive aspect, we hit the trough, and we are going back up. 

## Resumes are a process
Whether you are applying now or in the future, this process can help you prepare.
Don't wait for the application time; start now.

1. Start with the job description and do you research.
2. Build accomplishments (have a master document).
3. Choose relevant accomplishments for the job.
4. Build the resume.

## From Term 1
Think about the audience.
The purpose of a resume is to get an interview.
Remember the 7Cs.

> [!note]
> 
> Nobody has definitive resume info.  
> You speak to 3 experts, they will tell you different answers.  
> Everyone is trying to give you the best answers they have.  
> Ultimately, you must decide what info to use.  
> Incorporate as musch as you can from everyone you speak to.  
> Each resume reader has different ideas/needs/wants/hopes, so how can everyone know what everyone wants?
> 

Try to stick one page resume, but two is OK.

# Accomplishments
Focus on what you have done.
Accomplishment statements.
It may be as simple as all projects in Term 1/2 (including midterm and final).
And finally, emphasise results.
You many not think that you have enough, but you do!

Accomplishment statements structure your work.
These are expected by the industry.
You need to provide the evidence of a skill.

**Type 1**: Verb + Task + Result/Outcome.
These statements *can* be two lines long.  
Example: Created dynamic website with group of 4 using HTML 5 and CSS, resulting in 7-10 responsive pages.

**From Exercise**: 
* Implemented and tested a CLI game in Python with over 100 tests, resulting in a robust, bug-free program.
* Designed and constructed a web application via HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end and back-end interactions, resulting in 5 functional, mobile-friendly pages.
